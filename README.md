## What I learned

During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience and knowledge on various technologies and concepts. Here are some of my major takeaways:

- Single-Page Applications (SPAs): I learned how to create a SPA with React, allowing the site to load more quickly and feel more responsive to users.
- React: I deepened my understanding of React by using hooks to manage state and make reusable components.
- Redux Toolkit: I learned how to use Redux Toolkit to manage complex state more efficiently and streamline my development process.
- CSS modules: I used CSS modules for scoped styles, which made my code more modular and easier to maintain.
- LocalStorage: I used LocalStorage to persist data on the client-side, allowing users to save their cart data and continue shopping on return visits.
- Axios: I gained experience using Axios for making HTTP requests to my backend API.
- Debugging: I gained experience in debugging errors in my code and finding solutions to problems encountered throughout the project.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to apply my knowledge in a practical way.
